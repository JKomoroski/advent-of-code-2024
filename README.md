# Advent of Code - 2024
---

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) using Java 21 - hopefully using only the standard library.

### Requirements
- Java 21

### How To
- Create and add your inputs to `inputs/day-0x/in.txt`
- Build
  - `./mvnw clean install`
- Run
  -`java -cp target/aoc-2024-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar ski.komoro.aoc.twentyfour.Day02`
  - Where `Day02` is the name of the day you want to run
- If needed, update the Day class with an alternate input file like `test.txt` for the test input
